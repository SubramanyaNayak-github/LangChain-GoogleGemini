This ability also allows him to teleport and move at incredible speeds.\\n\\n2. **Cursed Technique Reversal: Red:** Gojo can reverse the flow of cursed energy, allowing him to absorb and redirect attacks. This technique is incredibly powerful and can even neutralize the strongest curses.\\n\\n3. **Blue:** Gojo can create a powerful barrier of cursed energy that can block and deflect attacks. This barrier is so strong that it can even withstand attacks from special-grade curses.\\n\\n4. **Domain Expansion: Unlimited Void:** Gojo's Domain Expansion creates a separate dimension where he has complete control over space and time. Within this domain, Gojo's powers are amplified, and he can trap and incapacitate his opponents with ease.\\n\\n5. **Six Eyes:** Gojo possesses the rare Six Eyes, which grant him exceptional perception and analytical abilities. This allows him to see through illusions, predict his opponents' moves, and identify cursed techniques with ease.\\n\\n6. **Cursed Energy Manipulation:** Gojo is highly proficient in manipulating cursed energy. He can use it to create powerful attacks, enhance his physical abilities, and heal his wounds.\\n\\n7. **Immense Physical Abilities:** Even without using his cursed techniques, Gojo possesses extraordinary physical strength, speed, and durability.
